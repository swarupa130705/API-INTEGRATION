    details: "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have revolutionized healthcare by enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses through machine learning algorithms. A notable development is the AI tool 'FaceAge,' which analyzes facial features to estimate the biological age of cancer patients, thereby predicting their survival outcomes. Trained on nearly 59,000 images of healthy individuals, FaceAge was tested on over 6,000 cancer patients. The findings revealed that patients whose FaceAge appeared older than their chronological age tended to have poorer survival rates. When combined with clinician assessments, FaceAge improved six-month survival prediction accuracy from 61% to 80%. This technology taps into 'perceived ageing' as a potent biomarker for disease prognosis, signaling a shift toward integrating AI-based age estimation in clinical decision-making to improve individualized patient care.",

The Brazilian presidency has called for creating enhanced global climate governance mechanisms aimed at accelerating the implementation of climate commitments made under the Paris Agreement. Marking the 10th anniversary of the Paris Accord, current plans still fall short, targeting about 2.6°C. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva initially proposed at the 2024 G20 summit the creation of a United Nations Climate Change Council to ensure effective enforcement of commitments. Ambassador Andre Correa do Lago, presiding over COP30, echoed this initiative, emphasizing that existing frameworks like UNFCCC lack the mandate for enforcement. Despite being in early stages, Brazil is actively seeking to gain international support for this proposal.",
